##### 2019 (MC) Spectral approximation of elliptic operators by the Hybrid High-Order method.pdf

1. `Lemma 3.2`: The description of jump notations in HHO.

    $$[u_{\mathcal{K}}]_F= u_{K_1}|_F - u_{K_2}|_F$$ where $$K_1$$,  $$K_2$$ are the two mesh cells sharing $$F$$.

2. Note that $$t$$ depends on $$\mu$$, but we just write $$t$$ instead of $$t_{\mu}$$ to alleviate the notation.

##### 2018 (IMAJNA) Virtual Element Method for Second Order Elliptic Eigenvalue Problems.pdf

1. For ease of exposition, we focus on the case of Dirichlet boundary conditions. The extension to other boundary conditions is analogous.
2. Finally, the eigensolutions of the continuous and the discrete problems $(2.2)$ and $(4.8)$ are, respectively, related to the eigenmodes of operators $T$ and $T_h$ in the sense that the corresponding eigenvalues are inverses of each other and their eigenspaces coincide. By virtue of this correspondence, the convergence analysis can be derived from spectral approximation theory for compact operators.

- hho-book:

  Whenever no ambiguity can arise, we omit both the dependence on $$\pmb x$$ and on the measure from integrals, and simply write $$\int_X v$$.

- 2016 (JSC) Direct Discontinuous Galerkin Method and Its Variations for Second Order Elliptic Equations: 

  With no ambiguity, for the rest of this article we use same letter $$u$$ instead of notation $$u_h$$ to represent DG numerical solution.

- 2015 (ChenLong CMA) An auxiliary space multigrid preconditioner for the weak Galerkin method:

  Therefore, later in the paper, we often identify these two if it cause no ambiguity.

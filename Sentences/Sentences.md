##### 2019 (MC) Spectral approximation of elliptic operators by the Hybrid High-Order method.pdf

1. `Lemma 3.2`: The description of jump notations in HHO.

    $$[u_{\mathcal{K}}]_F= u_{K_1}|_F - u_{K_2}|_F$$ where $$K_1$$,  $$K_2$$ are the two mesh cells sharing $$F$$.

2. Note that $$t$$ depends on $$\mu$$, but we just write $$t$$ instead of $$t_{\mu}$$ to alleviate the notation.

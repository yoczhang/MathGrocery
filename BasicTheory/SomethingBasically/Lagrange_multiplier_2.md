In calculus, Lagrange multipliers are commonly used for constrained  optimization problems. These types of problems have wide applicability  in other fields, such as economics and physics.  

The basic structure of a Lagrange multiplier problem is of the relation below: 
$$
\mathcal L(x,y;\lambda) = f(x,y) + \lambda g(x,y)
$$
where $$f(x,y)$$ is the function to be optimized, $$g(x,y)$$ is the constraint, and $$\lambda$$ is the Lagrange multiplier. Then, we set $$\nabla \mathcal L = \nabla f + \lambda \nabla g = 0$$ to solve the resulting system of equations; oftentimes, we wish to cancel out $$\lambda$$ in the process. These problems can easily be generalized to higher dimensions and more constraints.

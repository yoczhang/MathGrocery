## 英语论文中常见的转折用法

### **转折词的功能?**

转折是一个主题换到另一个主题之间的转变，可以藉由转折词或短语来表现。转折部分时常放在句首、独立子句和段落里，因此为不同的主题和想法之间建立连结。转折也是用来建立论文的「脉络」，并使各部分有逻辑地相互连接，进而让清楚易懂。

### **转折用法的分类**

我们可以将所有的转折用法分成四类:

- **Additive transitions** 提醒读者你要新增或参照其他资讯
- **Adversative transitions** 指出信息之间的冲突或不一致
- **Causal transitions** 指出后果和因果关系
- **Sequential transitions** 澄清顺序和信息的序列和论文的整体架构

### Additive Transitions

这一类的转折皆表示在句子和段落之间有新信息加入，功能包含介绍或强调重点、参照先前提到的信息、加上新的状况或指名某一部分的信息是相当重要的。

### **如何挑选正确的转折用法**

转折用法是写作中相当普遍的用法，但也应为很好用所以容易被误用或滥用，导致写作质量不佳。以下提供一些技巧帮助你挑选出最适当的转折用法:

- Check for overused, awkward, or absent transitions when you are  reading through and/or editing your paper. Don’t spend too much time  trying to find the “perfect” transition while writing the paper.
- When you a place where a transition could connect ideas, establish  relationships, and make it easier for the reader to understand your  point, use the list to find a suitable transition term or phrase.
- Similarly, if you have repeat some terms again and again, find a  substitute transition from the list and use that instead. This will help vary your writing and enhance communication of ideas.
- Read the beginning of each paragraph. Did you include a transition?  If not, look at the information in that paragraph and of the preceding  paragraph and ask yourself: “How does this information connect?” Then  locate the best transition from the list.
- Check the structure of your paper—are your ideas clearly laid out in order? You should be able to locate sequence terms such as “first,”  “second,” “following this,” “another,” “in addition,” “finally,” “in  conclusion,” etc. These terms will help outline your paper for the  reader.

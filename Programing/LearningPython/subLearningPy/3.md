## What is `::` (double colon) in Python?

See: [What is :: (double colon) in Python?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3453085/what-is-double-colon-in-python)

`a[::y]` it prints **every** $$y^{th}$$ **element** from the list/array, 

i.e.,

```python
>>> a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
>>> a[::3]
[1, 4, 7]
```

The additional syntax of `a[x::y]` means get every $$y^{th}$$ element starting at position `x`.

i.e.,

```python
>>> a[2::3]
[3, 6, 9]
```

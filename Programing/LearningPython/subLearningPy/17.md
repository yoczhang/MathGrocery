`numpy.array` is just a convenience function to create an `ndarray`; it is not a class itself. 

You can also create an array using `numpy.ndarray`, but it is not the recommended way. From the docstring of `numpy.ndarray`: 

> Arrays should be constructed using `array`, `zeros`or `empty`... The parameters given here refer to a low-level method (`ndarray(...)`) for instantiating an array.
